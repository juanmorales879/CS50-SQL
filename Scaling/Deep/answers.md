Q - Will the observations likely be evenly distributed across all boats, even if AquaByte most commonly collects observations between midnight and 1am? Why or why not?

A - Yes, the time does not influence the distributions of data across boats, each boat is selected randomly and will be evenly spread across boats.

Q - Suppose a researcher wants to query for all observations between midnight and 1am. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

A - On all boats because during midnight and 1 am any boat could contain an equal amount of observatios. So the researcher could miss observations if not running on all boats

Q - Will the observations likely be evenly distributed across all boats, even if AquaByte most commonly collects observations between midnight and 1am? Why or why not?

A - No, most likely Boat A will receive most of the observations since the observations are done during that timeframe

Q - Suppose a researcher wants to query for all observations between midnight and 1am. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

A - Only on some or one boat since observations are collected and stored at a specific timeframe

Q - Will the observations likely be evenly distributed across all boats, even if AquaByte most commonly collects observations between midnight and 1am? Why or why not?

A - Hash values are evenly distributed, thus the observations will also be evenly distributed

Q - Suppose a researcher wants to query for all observations between midnight and 1am. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

A - On all boats since hash value are evenly assigned and obsrvations could be contained evenly in any of the boats

Q - Suppose a researcher wants to query for a specific observation, which occurred at exactly 2023-11-01 00:00:01.020. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

A - Only on some boats, it is possible to know the hash value of a specific timestamp
